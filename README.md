# AI Agent using Together AI ü§ñ

Hi! This is a small Python project I made using AI API. It‚Äôs a basic Ai Agent that responds to your questions. I'm still learning, but I had fun building this and wanted to share it.

## üí° What it does

- You type a question or prompt
- It sends that to the Together AI model
- It shows you a response in the terminal

## üß∞ Tools Used

- Python
- Any AI API of your choice
- VS Code or any other code editor of your choice

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run It

1. Clone this repository
2. Go into the folder
3. Install the required packages
4. Add your AI API key in a `.env` file.
5. Run the Python file
6. Then just start chatting in the terminal



## Why I Made This

I‚Äôm learning AI and wanted to try building something with a real language model API. This helped me understand how LLMs work and how to use API keys securely.
